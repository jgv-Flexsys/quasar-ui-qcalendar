**Timestamp** is the low-level API that QCalendar uses internally to manipulate calendars. We have made it into its own package so you can use it if you wish.

<script import>
import TimestampApi from '@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/api/Timestamp.json'
</script>

<MarkdownApi :api="TimestampApi" name="Timestamp"/>
